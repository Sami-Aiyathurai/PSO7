```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Display Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Display plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. I plotted cars.
